### About Me
- Introduction

I want to discuss about my current situation. Now i am in a dillema.There is so much hesitation in me about my career choice. What will I do in the future? Which sector I am going to choose? There are so many choices. I make so many mistakes in my little. And still making. I never have a good guideline about my future. Nobody suggested to me you should do it, you are better at these or that.I came to Dhaka a couple of days ago, to do a course in frontend with React js. I have a vision in my life.If I told anyone about this they would laugh at me. Because my goal is very big. With this less resources, it will be very hard for me to achieve my goal. But I have faith in myself that I can do it. Allah is always with me. And I will do it insha'Allah.Please keep me in your prayers.

“And whoever fears Allah - He will make for him a way out, And will provide for him from where he does not expect. And whoever relies upon Allah - then He is sufficient for him,” (Surat at-Talaq portion of verses 2-3)

"And i will be always rely on Allah"(Golam Mowla)
